# RoadTest-GridEye
Code for  1-Wire速 Grid-EYE速 Sensor w/Arduino-Compatible PCB RoadTest

This repository contains the code used for the element14 RoadTest "1-Wire速 Grid-EYE速 Sensor w/Arduino-Compatible PCB".
The RoadTest aimed at testin and reviewing the Maxim Reference Design boards MAXREFDES131# (1-Wire GridEYE sensor) and MAXREFDES130# (Building Automation Shield).
The "Arduino" directory contains the Arduino firmware source code. To compile, use the Arduino IDE, taking care of adding the following libraries:
- OneWire (https://github.com/MaximIntegratedRefDesTeam/OneWire)
- OWGridEye (https://github.com/MaximIntegratedRefDesTeam/OWGridEye)
- MAX11300 (https://github.com/MaximIntegratedRefDesTeam/MAX11300)
- MAX4822 (https://github.com/MaximIntegratedRefDesTeam/MAX4822)
- ArduinoJson
The RPi directory contains python code for the server part.
